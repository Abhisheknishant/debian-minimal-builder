# FIXME
# I really dont want to hardcode an IP address here.  However:
# - hostnames need a resolver
# - modern resolvers use DNSSEC
# - DNSSEC needs certificates
# - certificates have not valid before/after dates
# - checking dates needs an accurate time
# - an accurate time needs NTP..  whoops, we are back at step 1
